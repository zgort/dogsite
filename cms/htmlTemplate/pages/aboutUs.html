            <p>
                I am a German shepherd fan since childhood; I raised my first pure bred GSD when I was 18 years old, after which I realized I could not live happily without this friendly loyal companion. My passion took me to Germany, Switzerland and Norway where I now have many well known GSD breeders as personal friends. For living I have a personal construction establishment that provides a decent income to live on. Raising and occasionally breeding GSDs is only a passion and therefore I am neither a commercial nor a professional breeder. I started the kennel upon many sincere requests by dear friends who could not afford importing a good pure bred GSD. I only own and care for GSDs, not any other breed, and I only breed when there are enough commitments from friends and acquaintances to provide proper homes and good care for the puppies. From a breeding some puppies will be given free to close friends and family members, and some will be sold to qualified persons at a reasonable price. The money will be used for feeding, caring for and training the foundation dogs.
